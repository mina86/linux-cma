\subsection{Solutions to the problem}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Reserve and assign at boot time}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Reserve memory during system boot time.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \code{mem} parameter.
    \item Memblock / bootmem.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Assign buffers to each device that might need it.
  \item While device is not being used, memory is wasted.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Reserve and allocate on demand}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Reserve memory during system boot time.
  \item Provide API for allocating from that reserved pool.
  \item Less memory is reserved.
  \item But it's still wasted.
  \end{itemize}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item bigphysarea
  \item Physical Memory Manager
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Reserve but give back}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Reserve memory during system boot time.
  \item Give it back
    \begin{itemize}
    \item but set it up so only movable pages can be allocated.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Provide API for allocating from that reserved pool.
  \item Migrate pages on allocation.
  \end{itemize}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Contiguous Memory Allocator
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
